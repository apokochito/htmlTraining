    <h4>Text: Time, Mark, and “Presentational”</h4>
    <div style="padding-left: 5%;">
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>Written by Doctor Who on <time datetime="2052-11-21">Thursday 21st November 2052</time>.</p>
      <p>&lt;p&gt; Written by Doctor Who on &lt;time datetime="2052-11-21"&gt;Thursday 21st November 2052&lt;/time&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
      <!-- <p>Written by Doctor Who on <time datetime="2052-11-21">Thursday 21st November 2052</time>.</p> -->
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>If the textual content of the time element is already machine readable, you don’t need the datetime attribute but it is required if it isn’t.</p>
      
      <h4>Example</h4>
      <p>He wants to play with his <mark>Legos</mark></p>
      <p>&lt;p&gt;He wants to play with his &lt;mark&gt;Legos&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
      <h4>Description</h4>
      <p>This is a form of emphasis, literally speaking, but it won’t always be considered emphasis in the original meaning (for example, the person being quoted above isn’t emphasizing “Legos”, the commenter is).</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The line above (&lt;hr&gt; tag) is used to set a thematic break, between pharagraphs.</p>
      <h4>Other “Presentational” tags</h4>
      <div style="padding-left: 5%;">
        <small>Text to test 1</small>
        <p>&lt;small&gt;Text to test 1&lt;/small&gt; It is used for small print</p>
        <br>
        <s>Text to test 2</s>
        <p>&lt;s&gt;Text to test 2&lt;/s&gt; It is used for text that is no longer correct</p>
        <br>
        <u>Text to test 3</u>
        <p>&lt;u&gt;Text to test 3&lt;/u&gt; It is used for text that is unarticulated</p>
        <br>
        <i>Text to test 4</i>
        <p>&lt;i&gt;Text to test 4&lt;/i&gt; It is is used for text in an alternate voice or representing a different quality of text.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Text to test 5</b>
        <p>&lt;b&gt;Text to test 5&lt;/b&gt; It stands for “text to which attention is being drawn without conveying importance or suggesting an alternative voice” (and even that’s paraphrasing).</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a <sub>Text to test 6</sub> sentence</p>
        <p>&lt;sub&gt;Text to test 6&lt;/sub&gt; “Must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation”</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is a <sup>Text to test 7</sup> sentence</p>
        <p>&lt;sup&gt;Text to test 7&lt;/sup&gt; “Must be used only to mark up typographical conventions with specific meanings, not for typographical presentation”</p>
